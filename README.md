## The Challenge

Working with and supporting an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) can be a challenging endeavor, especially if you're using
solutions/technologies that don't include comprehensive support tools for managing messages, errors, syncing,
and configurations.

There are many projects for ESB Message Admin that are designed to fill this gap, and each one will be documented here
as it becomes available.

## ESB Message Admin

Vendor agnostic ESB management platform with support for saving, tracking, and searching messages, and helps to streamline
various ESB administration tasks.

ESB Message Admin is an open source project built from the ground up to be very flexible.  This plugin based component
architecture enables deployment of ESB Message Admin in virtually any environment and with only the plugins needed
enabled.  This basically means you can deploy ESB Message Admin where you want and plug in the puzzle pieces you want!
